# My Games Collection iOS

My Games Collection is a practical app to manage your video game collection. You can add new games and categorize them using game genre and the platform that you own the game for. You can also edit details such as publisher, description, game modes and more.

The app also allows you to manage the genres, platforms and thumbnail images with an intuitive, easy-to-use interface.

Conveniently start your own collection from scratch or by importing the included sample content. Edit game thumbnail images by taking pictures, use your own photos or re-use existing thumbnails you have previously saved.
